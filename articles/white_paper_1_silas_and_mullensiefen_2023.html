<h2 id="overview">Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview"></a>
</h2>
<p>In this paper, we discuss the development of one of
<em>musicassessr</em>’s flagship tests, the <em>Singing Ability
Assessment</em> (<em>SAA</em>). The <a href="https://saa.musicassessr.com" class="external-link"><em>SAA</em></a> is designed to
evaluate various aspects of a human singing abilities and melodic
memory. The manuscript presents two online experiments with a total of
1,157 participants.</p>
<p>The <em>SAA</em> uses a probabilistic algorithm (<em>pYIN</em>;
Cannam et al., 2010) to transcribe audio of people singing and scores it
using statistical techniques. For long note singing, it identifies three
key factors: pitch accuracy, pitch volatility, and changes in pitch
stability. For singing melodies, the research uses a model that takes
into account aspects of the melody’s structure, such as tonality and
length, to predict how well a person can recall and sing back the
melody.</p>
<p>The results of the study show that the SAA scores are related to
existing measures of singing accuracy, demographic factors, and the
equipment used by the participants. As a result of this research, the
authors have also developed five open-source R packages to help
researchers conduct similar tests and experiments. These packages are
easy to access and can be adapted for various research settings.</p>

</h2>
<p>The text discusses the importance of assessing musical production,
particularly singing, and its integration with melodic memory research.
Here are the key points:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Lack of Attention to Musical Production: The text emphasizes that
musical production tests, which involve performing music, have been
underutilized compared to tests focusing on listening skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Perceptual vs. Participatory Nature: Perceptual musical ability
tests are criticized for not considering the participatory and embodied
nature of music, which involves active production.</p></li>
<li><p>Importance of Music Production: Recent research highlights that
understanding the production of music is crucial for a comprehensive
understanding of musical ability.</p></li>
<li><p>Methodological Challenges: The primary reason for the
underutilization of music production tests is methodological
difficulties in assessing musical behavior due to issues like “dirty
data.”</p></li>
<li><p>Singing as a Musical Production Test: The text introduces the
development of a singing test as a representative form of music
production test, which can be used to assess musical abilities and
enhance music education.</p></li>
<li><p>Melodic Recall and Singing Accuracy Research: The text points out
that research into melodic memory and singing accuracy is often
conducted separately, despite the inherent connection between the
two.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration of Singing Accuracy and Melodic Recall: The text
emphasizes the need to integrate singing accuracy and melodic recall
research to understand the relationship between low-level singing
abilities and high-level melodic memory.</p></li>
<li><p>Singing Accuracy and Melodic Recall Paradigms: The text discusses
various paradigms used in singing accuracy and melodic recall research,
including the Seattle Singing Accuracy Protocol (SSAP) and the Melodic
Recall Paradigm.</p></li>
<li><p>“Dirty” Musical Data: The text highlights the challenges related
to working with “dirty” musical data, which requires expert
interpretation and transcription from audio recordings.</p></li>
<li><p>Computational Approach: Advances in technology have made it
possible to automate and objectively measure produced musical behavior,
addressing some of the challenges of “dirty” data.</p></li>
<li><p>Singing Test Framework: The text introduces an open-source
framework for conducting singing tests and explains its features,
including real-time noise measurement and presenting stimuli based on
participants’ vocal ranges.</p></li>
<li><p>Integrating Singing Accuracy and Melodic Recall: The text
explains how singing accuracy and melodic recall can be integrated
through item response theory (IRT), a psychometric modeling
framework.</p></li>
<li><p>Motivations: The research aims to make singing tests more
accessible through an open-source framework and advances methodological
approaches in sung recall research.</p></li>
<li><p>Two-Fold Contribution: The research contributes to accessibility
and methodological advances by providing a transparent, open-source
singing test framework and addressing issues in sung recall
research.</p></li>
<li><p>Cognitive Modeling via IRT: The text discusses how item response
theory is used to relate structural features of melodies to cognitive
difficulty in melody processing.</p></li>
<li><p>The Present Study: The text introduces the Singing Ability
Assessment (SAA) and describes how it was developed, tested, and
validated through two experiments.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, the text highlights the importance of assessing musical
production, particularly singing, and discusses the challenges and
advancements in this area of research.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-1">Experiment 1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#experiment-1"></a>
</h3>
<p>Different measures were used to assess how well people recall and
sing melodies. Some measures produced similar results, while others,
like “aligned ordinal recall” and “PMI,” had limitations.</p>
<p>“Aligned ordinal recall” had issues with sensitivity to errors in
rhythm and harmony and did not penalize missed notes effectively. It
also had a strange effect where participants could score higher by
missing notes at the end of a melody.</p>
<p>Other measures were preferred because they rewarded participants for
singing more notes and approaching the true length of the melody. This
was not the case with “aligned ordinal recall.”</p>
<p>“Opti3,” a measure that considers various musical dimensions beyond
pitch and intervals, was found to be more comprehensive and ecologically
valid. It accounted for a wider range of musical errors and could
measure different aspects of musical accuracy simultaneously.</p>
<p>The use of “opti3” was chosen as the main way to measure how well
people remember and sing melodies in the next experiment.</p>

<h3 id="experiment-2">Experiment 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#experiment-2"></a>
</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Recall of Melodies Improves Over Time: When people try to
remember a melody, they tend to start with an incomplete recall on their
first attempt. With each subsequent try, they usually add more notes to
their recall. This process of recall improves over time, but it often
doesn’t reach a perfect match with the original melody, even after six
attempts.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning Curve Resembles an Exponential Curve: The improvement in
recalling melodies follows a curve that resembles an exponential shape.
It keeps increasing with each attempt but eventually levels off, usually
not reaching the full length of the target melody.</p></li>
<li><p>Different Aspects of Melodies Are Learned Differently: When
people recall melodies, they tend to focus on improving the earlier
parts of the melody, performing less well on the later notes they’ve
added more recently. However, when it comes to rhythm, the middle of the
melody is remembered better than the earlier or later parts.</p></li>
<li><p>Harmonic Elements May Not Improve Across Attempts: While other
aspects like rhythm and intervallic structure improve across recall
attempts, harmonic elements may remain stable. This suggests that people
might focus on pitch and interval information first, and when they can’t
recall more intervals, they switch to remembering rhythmic
details.</p></li>
<li><p>Melodies Are Built Simultaneously Across Different Aspects:
Instead of remembering different musical features separately, people
tend to build representations of melodies across various aspects
simultaneously. This approach may be more efficient and reflects the
interconnection of different melodic features.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual Differences in Melodic Recall: Some people remember
certain melodies better than others, possibly due to prior familiarity
with similar melodies or differences in their musical and nonmusical
memory skills.</p></li>
<li><p>Longer Melodies Are More Challenging: Longer melodies are more
difficult to remember because they require more notes to recall, and
this can strain working memory. The study suggests that the main
challenge in recalling melodies is often the sheer length of the melody
itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Audio Helps Memory: Learning melodies from full audio, rather
than symbolic representations like sheet music (MIDI), makes it easier
to remember. Acoustic features, lyrics, and the human voice may assist
memory in recalling melodies.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, this research suggests that the recall of melodies
improves over time, with the length of the melody being a significant
factor. Melodic features and musical experience also play a role in
memory, but the main challenge is often the sheer number of notes in
longer melodies. Learning melodies from audio tends to be more
effective, and musical expertise can help but isn’t always necessary for
better recall.</p>
