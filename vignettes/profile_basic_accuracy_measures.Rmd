## 1.1 Standard accuracy measure results

As shown in Figure 1: 1A) adding jitter to duration values causes *rhythfuzz* to degrade as well as *harmcore* (because it offsets the alignment of harmonic progressions), and consequently, *opti3*. All accuracy measures are unaffected. 1B) note insertions cause all measures to degrade, except accuracy and precision, which stay constant. Similarity measures generally degrade more prominently than accuracy-style measures, particularly *ngrukkon*; 1C) note deletions cause all measures to degrade, except *accuracy* and *recall*, which stay constant. Similarity measures generally degrade more quickly than accuacy-style measures, particularly *ngrukkon*; 1D) note deletions cause all measures degrade, except *rhythfuzz*, whichs stay constant. The other similarity measures (*ngrukkon*, *harmcore*, *opti3*) degrade more prominently than accuracy-style measures, particularly *ngrukkon*. 1E) combined pitch transformations (insertions, deletions and substitutions) cause all measures to degrade, but similarity measures more prominently than accuracy-style measures; 1F) combined pitch transformations (insertions, deletions and substitutions) and rhythmic jitter cause all measures to degrade, but similarity measures more prominently than accuracy-style measures; 1G) as the length of the recall increases towards the length of the target melody, all measures increase, except recall and accuracy, which are always 1; 1H) Scrambling the order of pitches affects no accuracy measures or *rhythfuzz*. All other similarity measures deteriorate as a function of scrambling.
