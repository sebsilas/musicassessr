<p>In this paper, we examined how people learn and recall melodies over
multiple attempts. In a first simulation experiment, we reasoned for
using similarity measures rather than accuracy-based measures to score
how well melodies are recalled. In the second experiment, 31
participants sang back 28 melodies, and the analysis aimed to predict
how similar their sung recalls were to the original melodies over
multiple attempts.</p>
<p>It was found that, as people try to recall long melodies, their
attempts tend to get longer over multiple attempts, and their overall
performance improves too. We concluded that when a melody is long enough
to require multiple attempts to sing back in full, the main factor
determining performance is the length of the target melody. Melodic
structure (e.g., tonality, intervals, rhythms) may be more critical for
shorter melodies or when dealing with more diverse types of melodies
than those used in their study.</p>

</h3>
<p>Different algorithmic measures were used to assess how well people
recall and sing melodies. Specifically, we profiled measures related to
the notion of “accuracy” against measures of melodic similarity. We
found that accuracy measures have notable limitations. Measures of
melodic similarity measures were preferred because they rewarded
participants for singing more notes and approaching the true length of
the melody, which was not always the case for accuracy measures.</p>

<p><em>opti3</em>,” a measure that considers various musical dimensions
beyond pitch and intervals, was found to be more comprehensive and
ecologically valid. It accounted for a wider range of musical errors and
could measure different aspects of musical accuracy simultaneously. The
use of <em>opti3</em> was chosen as the main way to measure how well
people remember and sing melodies in Experiment 2.</p>

Perspective.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#experiment-2-how-do-we-learn-melodies-a-melodic-similarity-based-perspective-"></a>
</h3>
<p>We summarise the key results of Experiment 2:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Recall of Melodies Improves Over Time: When people try to remember a
melody, they tend to start with an incomplete recall on their first
attempt. With each subsequent try, they usually add more notes to their
recall. This process of recall improves over time, but it often doesn’t
reach a perfect match with the original melody, even after six
attempts.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="white_paper_2_figure_1.png" width="500"></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Learning Curve Resembles an Exponential Curve: The improvement in
recalling melodies follows a curve that resembles an exponential shape.
It keeps increasing with each attempt but eventually levels off, usually
not reaching the full length of the target melody.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="white_paper_2_figure_2.png" width="768"></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Different Aspects of Melodies Are Learned Differently: When people
recall melodies, they tend to focus on improving the earlier parts of
the melody, performing less well on the later notes they’ve added more
recently. However, when it comes to rhythm, the middle of the melody is
remembered better than the earlier or later parts.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="white_paper_2_figure_5.png" width="470"></p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Harmonic Elements May Not Improve Across Attempts: While other
aspects like rhythm and intervallic structure improve across recall
attempts, harmonic elements may remain stable. This suggests that people
might focus on pitch and interval information first, and when they can’t
recall more intervals, they switch to remembering rhythmic details.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="white_paper_2_figure_3.png" width="516"></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Melodies Might Be Learned Simultaneously Across Different
Aspects: Instead of remembering different musical features separately,
we argued that <em>perhaps</em> people tend to build representations of
melodies across various aspects simultaneously. This approach may be
more efficient and reflects the interconnection of different melodic
features.</p></li>
<li><p>Individual Differences in Melodic Recall: Some people remember
certain melodies better than others, possibly due to prior familiarity
with similar melodies or differences in their musical and nonmusical
memory skills.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="white_paper_2_figure_4.png" width="960"></p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Longer Melodies Are More Challenging: Longer melodies are more
difficult to remember because they require more notes to recall, and
this can strain working memory. The study suggests that the main
challenge in recalling melodies is often the sheer length of the melody
itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Audio Helps Memory: Learning melodies from full audio, rather
than symbolic representations like sheet music (MIDI), makes it easier
to remember. Acoustic features, lyrics, and the human voice may assist
memory in recalling melodies.</p></li>
<li><p>Target Melody Length Affects Sung Recall Performance <em>Via</em>
The Attempt Length: In a mediation model, we show that longer melodies
lead to longer attempts, which generally result in higher melodic
similarity scores. However, the increased complexity of longer melodies
negatively affects melodic similarity scores, balancing out the overall
bivariate relationship, making it statistically insignificant.</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>This research suggests that the recall of melodies improves over time
and multiple hearings, with the length of the target melody being a
significant factor in . Melodic features and musical experience also
play a role in memory, but the main challenge is often the sheer number
of notes in longer melodies. Learning melodies from audio tends to be
more effective, and musical expertise can help but isn’t always
necessary for better recall.</p>
