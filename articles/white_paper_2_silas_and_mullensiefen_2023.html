<p>In this paper, we examined how people learn and recall (i.e., sing
back) melodies over multiple attempts. In a first simulation experiment,
we reasoned for using similarity measures rather than accuracy-based
measures to score how well melodies are recalled. In a second
experiment, 31 participants sang back 28 melodies, and the analysis
aimed to predict how similar their sung recalls were to the original
melodies over multiple attempts.</p>
<p>It was found that, as people try to recall long melodies, their
attempts tend to get longer over multiple attempts, and their overall
performance improves too. We concluded that when a melody is long enough
to require multiple attempts to sing back in full, the main factor
determining performance is the length of the target melody. Melodic
structure (e.g., tonality, intervals, rhythms) may be more critical for
shorter melodies or when dealing with more diverse types of melodies
than those used in this study.</p>

</h2>
<p>Different algorithmic measures which can assess how well people
recall and sing melodies were profiled. Specifically, we profiled
measures related to the notion of “accuracy” against measures of melodic
similarity. We found that accuracy measures have notable limitations.
Measures of melodic similarity measures were preferred because they
reward participants for singing more notes - and approaching the true
length of the melody. This was not always the case for accuracy
measures.</p>

<p><em>opti3</em> (Müllensiefen &amp; Frieler, 2004), a measure of of
melodic similarity that considers various musical dimensions beyond
pitch and intervals, was argued to be more comprehensive and
ecologically valid than accuracy measures. It accounted for a wider
range of musical errors and could measure different aspects of musical
behaviour simultaneously. We chose <em>opti3</em> as the main way to
measure how well people remember and sing melodies in Experiment 2 (and
in the <code>musicassessr</code> framework!).</p>

</h2>
<p>We summarise the key results of Experiment 2:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Length Of Recall and Overall Recall Performance Grow Over Attempts:
When people try to remember and recall a melody, they tend to start with
an incomplete recall on their first attempt. With each subsequent try,
they usually add more notes to their recall, and the similarity of their
recall to the target also improves over attempts. However, their
performance often doesn’t reach a perfect match with the original
melody, even after six attempts.</li>
</ol>

rescaled [0,1]
</p>
</div>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Learning Curve Resembles an Exponential Curve: The improvement
in recalling melodies follows a curve that resembles an exponential
shape. It keeps increasing with each attempt but eventually levels off,
usually not reaching the full length of the target melody.</li>
</ol>

vs. empirical descriptive results
</p>
</div>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Different Sections of Melodies Are Learned Differently: When people
recall melodies, they tend to focus on improving the earlier parts of
the melody, performing less well on the later notes they’ve added more
recently. However, when it comes to rhythm, the middle of the melody is
remembered better than the earlier or later parts. Perhaps participants
first focus on intervallic information, then switch to focusing on
rhythmic information (a different type of musical information) when they
have recalled all the intervallic information they can remember. This
resonates with the idea of domain-specific interference in working
memory (Jarrold et al., 2011).</li>

</p>
</div>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Harmonic Performance May Not Improve Across Attempts: While other
aspects like rhythm and intervallic structure show clear improvements
across recall attempts, harmonic elements seem to remain stable.</li>

</div>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Melodies Might Be Learned Simultaneously Across Different Musical
Dimensions: Instead of remembering different musical features (e.g.,
tonality, intervals, rhythms) independently, we argued that
<em>perhaps</em> people tend to build representations of melodies across
various aspects simultaneously. This should be more cognitively
efficient and reflects the tendency of different melodic features to
correlate with one another (Baker, 2021).</p></li>
<li><p>Individual Differences in Melodic Recall: Some people remember
certain melodies better than others, possibly due to prior familiarity
with similar melodies or differences in their musical and nonmusical
memory skills. However, not all recall performance is explained in terms
of musical experience, suggesting a role for domain-general memory
faculties.</p></li>

<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Longer Melodies Are More Challenging: Longer melodies are more
difficult to remember because they require more notes to recall, and
this can strain working memory. We suggest that the main challenge in
recalling melodies is often the sheer length of the melody
itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Full Audio Representation Helps Memory: Learning melodies from
full audio, rather than symbolic representations with simple spectral
representations(MIDI), makes them easier to remember. Acoustic features,
lyrics, and the human voice may assist memory in recalling
melodies.</p></li>
<li><p>Target Melody Length Affects Sung Recall Performance <em>Via</em>
The Attempt Length: In a mediation model, we show that longer melodies
lead to longer attempts (because longer melodies require more notes to
be sung); longer attempts generally result elicit higher melodic
similarity scores (because they presumably reflect incidental
improvements in recalling the melody across musical dimensions).
However, the increased complexity of longer melodies negatively affects
melodic similarity scores directly, balancing out the overall bivariate
relationship between target melody length and sung recall performance
(<em>opti3</em>), making it statistically insignificant. This is known
as “inconsistent mediation” whereby two opposing effects work against
each other.</p></li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>This research suggests that the recall of melodies improves over time
and multiple hearings, with the length of the target melody being the
main significant factor. Melodic features and musical experience also
play a role in memory, but the main challenge is often the sheer number
of notes in long melodies. Learning melodies from audio tends to be more
effective, and musical expertise can help, but isn’t always necessary
for better recall.</p>
